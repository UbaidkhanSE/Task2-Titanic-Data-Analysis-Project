# Task2-Titanic-Data-Analysis-Project

This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and examination of relationships between various features and survival rates.
Introduction
The Titanic dataset provides information about the passengers on the Titanic, including their age, sex, ticket class, fare, and whether they survived. This project aims to uncover insights and patterns in the data through detailed EDA and various visualization techniques.

# Data Cleaning
•	Filled missing values in the age column with the median age.
•	Filled missing values in the embarked column with the most common value.
•	Dropped rows with missing values in embark_town and deck.
•	Converted the survived column to string type for categorical plotting.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA involves the following analyses:
1.	Survival Rate by Passenger Class
2.	Survival Rate by Gender
3.	Survival Distribution by Age
4.	Survival Count by Embarkation Port
5.	Fare Distribution
6.	Survival Rate by Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard (SibSp)
7.	Survival Rate by Number of Parents/Children Aboard (Parch)
8.	Pairplot of Numerical Features
9.	Correlation Heatmap
10.	Survival Rate by Deck
11.	Age Distribution by Passenger Class and Gender
12.	Survival Rate by Ticket Class and Embarkation Port

# Visualization Techniques
We use various visualization techniques to understand the dataset better:
•	Bar plots
•	Histograms with KDE
•	Count plots
•	Pair plots
•	Correlation heatmaps
•	Box plots
# Results
The analysis reveals significant insights into the survival patterns of the Titanic passengers. For example:
•	Higher survival rates were observed in first-class passengers and females.
•	Younger passengers had a slightly higher chance of survival.
•	Passengers embarked from Cherbourg had a higher survival rate compared to other ports.
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis and visualization can uncover meaningful patterns and insights in a dataset. The findings can inform further predictive modeling and decision-making processes.
